## What is this?

This is an easy to understand example based tutorial aimed at those who know a little of Go and nothing of webdev and want to learn how to write a webserver in Go. You will create a to do list application as you advance the chapters.

Please use the `front end` folder in the `code` folder to get the index.html of the Tasks project and work on it while reading this tutorial.

## Code

There is a code section available in the Github repo for reference. The code is available for the "Introduction to Go" chapter. For all other chapters, please refer to the [http://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks](http://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks), which contains the complete application which you'll build in this book. I use the Tasks application to manage my Todo Lists, so the app will keep getting updated with new features.

You can also refer to the code accompanied by the YouTube series, [here](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/write-webapps-in-go-video). The code is published as branches, each video has a particular branch.

## Contributing

I don't profess to be a God of either Go or webdev or anything in general, and I don't claim that this is the best book for learning how to build web appplications with Go, but I do believe that good things happen when people collaborate, so pull requests are not only appreciated, but they are welcome.

I got feedback from a reddit user that maybe it is too early for me to start writing this book. Decades ago, a young student from the University of Helsinki had an endless debate with Andrew Tannenbaum on comp.minix. It was about monolithic kernels. Had the student listened to Andrew Tannenbaum, the world probably would not have had Linux. This is the whole point of open source projects, a little initiative from everyone goes a long way. I would like to thank everyone who gave their suggestions on reddit and HN.

## Philosophy

* Through this book we want to teach how to develop web applications in Go. We expect the reader to know the basics of Go but we assume the reader knows **nothing** about how to write web applications.
* The book shall comprise of chapters, if the topic is huge and doesn't fit into one chapter, then we split into multiple chapters, if possible.
* Each chapter should be split into logical parts or sections with a meaningful title which'll teach the reader something.
* Every concept should be accompanied by the Go code \(if there is any\), for _sneak peek_ type sections write the Go pseudo code, writing just the necessary parts of the code and keeping everything else.
* The code shouldn't be more than 80 characters wide because in the PDF versions of the book the code is invisible.
* _Brevity is the soul of wit_, please keep the description as small as possible. This doesn't mean we skip it, but try to explain it in as simple words as possible.
    in such cases do explain the concept.
* In the todo list manager which we are creating, we'll strive to implement as much functionality as possible to give a taste of practical Go programming to the reader. In cases where we re-implement stdlib stuff, we should mention it clearly.
* The main title should have one \#, sections should have 2 \#'s sub section should have 4 and notes should have 6 \#'s \(note should have a title too\).
* Multi-line code should have three tabs indentation, single line of code can be indented using tabs or by backticks.

Written with love in India.
